AMS(MOS) subject classifications . 68P05, 68Q25, 68R9 9 The standard union-find data structure is simple to describe, yet has a complex analysis . Traditionally the amortized analysis of this structure is done using the accounting method . We present a simple, new potential-based analysis covering several of the most interestin g results.},

@inproceedings{Pietracaprina2003,
abstract = {We present a depth-first algorithm, PatriciaMine, that discovers all frequent itemsets in a dataset, for a given sup- port threshold. The algorithm is main-memory based and employs a Patricia trie to represent the dataset, which is space efficient for both dense and sparse datasets, whereas alternative representations were adopted by previous algo- rithms for these two cases. A number of optimizations have been introduced in the implementation of the algorithm. The paper reports several experimental results on real and ar- tificial datasets, which assess the effectiveness of the im- plementation and show the better performance attained by PatriciaMine with respect to other prominent algorithms.},
